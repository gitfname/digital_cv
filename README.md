Hi welcome to my CV.

I'm **Alpay**  from Iran. i know a little bit of English ( i think i'm B1 level  😅 ). <br>i'm interested in web developing  ( **FullStack** ). 
but so far i'm junior FrontEnd developer ( i mean a real junior 😐 ). these useless projects below are some of my projects ( as you  can see their still in progress 😟.<br> did i mentioned that these projects are useless 😟 i don't why but i mostly create useless projects/apps like below projects in 3 or 4 or 1 week. and then deleting them  😐.<br> may be it's because i have some problems with myself ).
but whatever.
i created this repo for showing my projects. if you have any idea or suggestion then please tell me ( why do you want to have conversation with me ?? 😔 )
